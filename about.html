            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>I discovered my passion for web development when I built my first
website in college. Since then, I've been fascinated by the intersection of desi
gn and functionality, always striving to create digital experiences that are both
beautiful and user-friendly.</p>

            <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new coffee shops,
reading tech blogs, or working on personal projects that challenge me to learn
new technologies.</p>
